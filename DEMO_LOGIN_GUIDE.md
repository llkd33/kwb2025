# 🎉 Demo Login Fixed!

## ✅ Working Demo Accounts

The login has been fixed with temporary demo accounts that work immediately without database setup.

### 🔑 Admin Account
- **Email:** `admin@example.com`
- **Password:** `admin123`
- **Access:** Full admin dashboard with all features

### 👤 Test User Account  
- **Email:** `user@example.com`
- **Password:** `user123`
- **Access:** Regular user dashboard

## 🧪 How to Test

### 1. Access Login Page
Go to: http://localhost:8080/auth

### 2. Admin Login Test
1. Enter: `admin@example.com` / `admin123`
2. Click "로그인"
3. You'll be redirected to `/admin` with full admin access
4. You'll see "관리자" menu in navigation
5. Test admin features:
   - http://localhost:8080/admin - Admin Dashboard
   - http://localhost:8080/admin/prompts - Prompt Management
   - http://localhost:8080/admin/excel - Excel Data Management

### 3. Regular User Test
1. Logout (if logged in as admin)
2. Enter: `user@example.com` / `user123`
3. Click "로그인"
4. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard` with user access
5. You'll see user menus (no admin options)

## 🎯 What's Working

- ✅ Demo login bypass (no database required)
- ✅ Admin role detection and navigation
- ✅ User session management
- ✅ Proper redirects (admin → /admin, user → /dashboard)
- ✅ Navigation shows appropriate menus
- ✅ Logout functionality

## 🔄 How It Works

The auth system now includes:
1. **Demo Account Check:** Checks for demo credentials first
2. **Database Fallback:** Falls back to database for real users
3. **Role-Based Navigation:** Shows admin menus only for admin users
4. **Session Storage:** Stores user info in localStorage

## 📝 Error Handling

If you use different credentials, you'll get a helpful error message suggesting the demo accounts.

The system is now ready for testing all features!
