## Test Configuration

```typescript
// Test environment
- Browser: Chromium
- Viewport: Desktop (1280x720) and Mobile (375x667)
- Base URL: http://localhost:8080
- Framework: Playwright Test
```

## Conclusion

The frontend application is well-structured and functional. The main blocking issues are:
1. Missing OpenAI API key for AI features
2. Supabase backend services need configuration
3. Minor security vulnerabilities in dependencies

Once these configuration items are addressed, the application should be ready for production deployment.
