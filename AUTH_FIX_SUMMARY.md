# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing 400 errors when trying to authenticate users. The errors were showing "Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 400 ()" for the Supabase authentication endpoint.

## Root Cause
1. No test users existed in the Supabase Auth system
2. The frontend code was incorrectly checking passwords by comparing plain text passwords with database values
3. The authentication flow was mixing Supabase Auth with manual password checks

## Solution Applied

### 1. Created Test User
- Created a test user setup script (`scripts/setup-test-user.js`)
- Test credentials:
  - Email: `test@knowwhere.com`
  - Password: `TestPassword123!`
- The script creates both:
  - Supabase Auth user (for authentication)
  - Company profile record (for application data)

### 2. Fixed Authentication Logic
- Removed redundant password check from `src/pages/Auth.tsx` (line 91)
- Supabase Auth already handles password verification securely
- The application should rely on Supabase Auth for authentication, not manual password checks

## How to Test
1. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to the login page
3. Use the test credentials:
   - Email: `test@knowwhere.com`
   - Password: `TestPassword123!`
4. You should be able to log in successfully

## Recommendations for Production

### Security Improvements Needed:
1. **Remove password field from companies table** - Passwords should only be managed by Supabase Auth
2. **Use proper user authentication flow**:
   - User signs up â†’ Supabase Auth creates user
   - Company profile is created separately (without password)
   - Login uses only Supabase Auth
3. **Implement proper password hashing** if passwords must be stored separately (not recommended)
4. **Add rate limiting** to prevent brute force attacks
5. **Implement proper session management** using Supabase Auth sessions

### Current Workarounds:
- The `password` field in the companies table is currently required by the schema
- For testing, we're storing the plain text password (NOT SECURE FOR PRODUCTION)
- The authentication check has been simplified to rely on Supabase Auth

## Next Steps
1. Test the authentication with the provided credentials
2. Consider migrating to a proper authentication flow without storing passwords in the companies table
3. Implement proper role-based access control using Supabase Auth metadata
